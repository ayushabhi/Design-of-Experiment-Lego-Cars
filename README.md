# Design of Experiment Lego Cars
This project centers on applying Design of Experiment (DOE) principles to optimize a Lego car's performance. By systematically varying factors like car length, load type, tire size, number of tires, and car height, the goal was to pinpoint the optimal parameter combination to maximize the Lego car's covered distance.

# Introduction
Design of Experiment is a potent methodology widely used across various fields to optimize processes and enhance outcomes. In this project, we applied DOE principles to refine the Lego car's performance, utilizing statistical tools, including Minitab, to identify key factors influencing its travel distance.

# Objective
The main project objective was to determine the optimal combination of factors resulting in the Lego car covering the maximum distance. This involved systematically varying selected parameters and using statistical analysis, particularly Minitab, to identify the most influential factors.

# Data
Factors considered for this experiment were:

1. Car length
2. Load type
3. Tire size
4. Number of tires
5. Car height

These factors were systematically manipulated to create a well-designed set of experiments.

# Minitab Implementation
In the realm of statistical analysis, Minitab, a robust and sophisticated software tool, played an indisputably pivotal role. The project's initial phase witnessed the creation of a one-half fraction experiment employing the sparsity of effects. Minitab facilitated the meticulous recording of the distance covered by the Lego car for each factor combination, followed by a meticulous analysis of the collected data, ultimately contributing to the creation of a predictive model.

The second phase, equally meticulous in its approach, involved Minitab's instrumental role in refining the model. This was achieved through the elimination of non-significant factors, a process grounded in a single experiment. This phase, characterized by an exhaustive and meticulous statistical analysis, enabled Minitab to identify and retain only those factors that significantly influenced the Lego car's travel distance. This meticulous step proved to be crucial in achieving the project's overarching goal - the creation of an optimized model with the highest accuracy in predicting the covered distance.

# Procedure
The experiment was meticulously planned and executed in two phases. In the initial phase, a one-half fraction experiment was designed using the principle of sparsity of effects, with the distance covered by the Lego car carefully recorded for each combination of factors. The collected data underwent comprehensive analysis using Minitab to develop a predictive model.

In the second phase, the same rigorous approach was applied to eliminate non-significant factors based on the model's analysis. Insights from the initial experiment informed this decision-making process, allowing only the most significant factors to be considered. The ultimate goal was to develop an optimized model capable of predicting the distance covered with the highest accuracy.

# Results and Discussion
The results of this detailed experiment, achieved through thorough analysis using Minitab, revealed the optimal combination of parameters that allowed the Lego car to cover the maximum distance. The ensuing discussion section provides a careful examination of the significance of each factor, scrutinizes the implications of the results, and explores potential applications for further optimization.

This comprehensive project serves as a prime example of the effectiveness of Design of Experiment in systematically enhancing a process, with Minitab proving to be an indispensable tool for statistical analysis and model refinement. It not only provides valuable insights into the various factors influencing the performance of the Lego car but also establishes a strong foundation for future enhancements and explorations in this field.
